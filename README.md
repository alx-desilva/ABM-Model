# Target Prediction and Interception

A model created during my honors cs class in high school.   Focused on predicting and leading interceptors to targets based on radar pings. 

The intercept course it found using functions of time for both the interceptor and the target. It will solve for the time both objects will be at the same point, then return said point.



## Models
There are two models in the repository. One is a single model graph, where i was originaly tested my equations. The other is the full model.

## Lessons Learned

The math was pretty challenging for me. At the time of writing this, my math level is about pre-calculus. Doing research and figuring out how to create my intercept equation was definitly hardest, but most rewarding part.
